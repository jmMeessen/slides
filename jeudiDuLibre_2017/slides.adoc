== You and Docker ? ==

[%step]
* Never heard about it ?
* Some "Proof of Concept" ?
* Use it every day ?
* In Production ?

== Today's talk

* What are "containers" ?
* How to start ?
* The principles (single container)
* Multiple containers (Docker Compose)
* Multi-hosts (Docker Swarm)

== Docker Containers

[%step]
* is not a virtualization technique,
* rather an *isolation* technology.


== !

image::images\vm-and-container.png[width=100%]

image::images\container_vs_vm.jpg[width=110%]


== Docker Containers are :

[%step]
* NameSpaces
** isolates and virtualizes system resources
*** (process, mounts, networking)
* cgroups (control groups)
** limits CPU, memory, IOs, etc

== !

image::images\why-docker-lightweight.jpg[width=110%]


== Applications packaged with system dependencies

* new packaging paradigm
* one application works on Ubuntu with Python 2
* second application works on Centos 7.2 with Python 3


== What Docker solves

[%step]
* Escape the dependencies hell
* Fast iterative Infrastructure improvement
* Container "loader" & Container "shipper"
** (no more "it worked in Dev, now it's OPS problem")
* easy onboarding of Devs.
* "Own test environment"

== sandbox

*  http://play-with-docker.com/
** Validate captcha
** 4 hours to play with "Docker instances"
** Just click "Add a new instance"
** Machine starts and you have access to the command line


== Need a container-enabled "Kernel"

* 64-bit Linux installation
* version 3.10 or higher of the Linux kernel
* recommend using the Docker repositories
** See the Docker online documentation https://www.docker.com/products/overview

== And on Windows or Mac OS X ?

[%step]
* Installed in a virtual machine (ex VirtualBox)
** Running Linux
* Ready made bundles:
** Docker Toolbox (Mac / Windows)
** Docker for Mac (native, uses `xhyve`)
* Using (corporate) proxies: advanced topic

== Docker for Windows

* "on" != "for"
* Runs native Windows applications 
* with Hyper-V
* 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education

== How do you get images ?

* you get them from
** DockerHub
** Corporate Registry
* Or build it yourself

== Building a Docker Image

* Described in a Dockerfile

== Describe a complete Infrastructure

* Complex systems
** Fuse ESB server
** MQ series servers
** Oracle database
* Use "docker-compose"

== docker-compose

* one place to define
** your components
** how to (docker) build them
** what container should start first
** networks (who can talk to whom)
** (data) volumes
** Security restrictions
** Etc.

== docker-compose

* three step process
** dockerfile of individual images
** Define services
*** Run parameters
*** Network Relationships
*** dependencies
** `docker-compose up`

== docker-compose

* Commands to manage the whole application lifecycle
** Start, stop and rebuild services
** View the status of running services
** Stream the log output of running services
** Run a one-off command on a service

== Demo

== Try it

* connect to wifi `PI-LAB` with password `raspberry`
* in browser, connect to `http://rpi3-1.local:5000` to vote.

== Docker Inc.

[%step]
* Docker has been surprised by this techno "flare"
* Very, very lively Open Source community
* "Batteries included"
* Standardization (RunC, etc.)

== Well grounded approach

* Coming from the web hosting world

image::images/docker_unusable_scy.jpg[width=80%]

== Status

* Was good for development and integration
* Start to be usable for Real Life Run
** Since December 2015

== Status

* Start to offer enterprise level solutions
** "Docker Datacenter"
*** Trusted Registry (Image scanning, sig/auth)
*** Docker Universal Control Plane
** Docker Cloud

== Docker in Production

* you need to have a very good understanding of what you do
* still in the early phase
* Docker works very well for **state less** application
* State full (with databases, etc) still in infancy. Recent announcement very promising

== What are the dangers with Docker?

[%step]
* Kernel exploits
* Denial of service attack
* Container breakout
* Poisoned images
* Compromising Secrets

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Amplification.
* un container peut tout bloquer
* sortir
* Poisoned images
* access DB
--

== Is Docker "secure" ?

* A lot of expectations, of illusions
* "Silver bullet"
* Competition positioning (VM, Configuration Mgt)
* Enviousness

== "Container do not contain !"

* Wrong perception by the "public"
* Tremendous progress in 3 years
** but usable...

== Equipped with security tools

== In particular

* Cap drop
* User namespace
* selinux / apparmor

== Capability Drop

* options to the "Docker run"
* goes beyond the root/non-root dichotomy
* example: container with NTP

----
docker run --cap-drop ALL --cap-add SYS_TIME ntpd
----

== Selinux / apparmor

* profiles are called at each "Docker run"
* Allow to go much further in the granularity
** this program (ex ping) has no access to the network

== !

== "Clean" containers?

== !

* Malicious contents
* Contains vulnerabilities or bugged applications

== Trusted Registry

* Systematic use of TLS
* Re-enforcement of the layers integrity
* Upgraded with version 1.10

== Notary

* System of image signature and its validation
** Validation of the author and content non alteration
* Protection Against Image Forgery
* Protection Against Replay Attacks
* Protection Against Key Compromise
** Clever usage of physical key storage


== Nautilus

* (now called "Docker Security Scanning")
* Docker image scanner
** vulnerabilities (CVE check)
** Licence validation
** Image Optimisation
** Simplified functional tests


== Recommendations

image::images/prevention.jpg[prevention,550]

== Recommendations

[%step]
* Keep your host/images up-to-date
* "Bulkheading"
** Seperate disk partition for Docker
** Don't run other (non-Docker) applications on the same host
** Container in a VM ?
* Limit inter-container communications
* log/audit trails
* Access control

== Recommendations

[%step]
* Do not use "priviliged" if it is not necessary
* Applicative users in the containers
* Where are my images coming from ? are they up-to-date ?
* Access rights on the files

== Conclusions

* "Is Docker 'secure' ?"
** No more or less then the door of an apartment
* Security is everyone's business : DevOps + SecOps
