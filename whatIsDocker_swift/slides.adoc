== You and Docker ? ==

[%step]
* Never heard about it ?
* Some "Proof of Concept" ?
* Use it every day ?
* In Production ?

== Today's talk

* What are "containers" ?
* How to start ?
* Where is Docker heading ?

Docker Container is an analogy to the revolution in the Shipping industry brought by the container.

== Docker Containers are :

* Isolated namespace (process, users, network, cgroups, etc)
* Lightweight "virtualized servers"
* A new artifact paradigm

== !

[NOTE.speaker]

- Draw the attention on the Docker process.
- Containers are old, LXC (OpenVZ) been around for some time.
- Container load fast
--

== Applications packaged with system dependencies

* one application works on Ubuntu with Python 2
* second application works on Centos 7.2 with Python 3

== Execution mode

** Container can run and then exit
** Container can in background (daemon)

== Demo


== What Docker solves

[%step]
* Escape the dependencies hell
* Fast iterative Infrastructure improvement
* Container "loader" & Container "shipper"
** (no more "it worked in Dev, now it's OPS problem")
* easy onboarding of Devs.
* "Own test environment"

pass:[<p style="font-size:400%; font-family: 'League Gothic', Impact, sans-serif;">How to start ?</p>]

== Need a container enabled "Kernel"

== Linux or Windows 10 (beta)

== Install the Docker "daemon"

== Docker client

* Run, stop, halt container
* Remove stopped container
* Examine logs
* etc.

== And for Windows or Mac OS X ?

[%step]
* Install a virtual machine (ex VirtualBox)
* Ready made bundles:
** Docker Toolbox
** New, better integrated, clients
* Using (corporate) proxies: advanced topic

== Then you need images

[%step]
* Note: an image is immutable
* you get them from
** DockerHub
** Corporate Registry
* Or build it yourself

== Building a Docker Image

* Described in a Dockerfile

== Docker Inc.

[%step]
* Docker has been surprised by this techno "flare"
* Very, very lively Open Source community
* "Batteries included"
* Standardization (RunC, etc.)

== Well grounded approach

* Coming from the hosting world

image::images/docker_unusable_scy.jpg[width=80%]

== Status

* Was good for development and integration
* Start to be usable for Real Life Run
** Since December 2015

== Status

* Start to offer enterprise level solutions
** "Docker Datacenter"
*** Trusted Registry (Image scanning, sig/auth)
*** Docker Universal Control Plane
** Docker Cloud

== Docker in production ?

This is, in general, the reaction...

== The problem ==

* Docker's popularity reflects the pass:[<u>quest for less and less friction</u>].
* Its ease of use leads to compromises and to neglect verification.

== !

And yet *Security* is important.


== And why ? ==

* Our customers entrust us their systems / their data.
* No sanctions for failing Companies
** security is only seen as a cost
** no "polluter pays" principle

== !

I believe that we have a moral responsibility to remind our managers of the good (security) practices.

== What are the dangers with Docker?

[%step]
* Kernel exploits
* Denial of service attack
* Container breakout
* Poisoned images
* Compromising Secrets

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Amplification.
* un container peut tout bloquer
* sortir
* Poisoned images
* access DB
--

== Is Docker "secure" ?

* A lot of expectations, of illusions
* "Silver bullet"
* Competition positioning (VM, Configuration Mgt)
* Enviousness

== Docker, Inc and security

* Security (= operability) is one of their fundamental preoccupation
* Aware of the youth of the technology
* Very reactive
* Positive attitude in the approach

== In particular

* Cap drop
* User namespace
* selinux / apparmor

== Capability Drop

* options to the "Docker run"
* goes beyond the root/non-root dichotomy
* example: container with NTP

docker run --cap-drop ALL --cap-add SYS_TIME ntpd

== User namespace

== With User namespace

== Selinux / apparmor

* profiles are called at each "Docker run"
* Allow to go much further in the granularity
** this program (ex ping) has no access to the network

* Docker image scanner
** vulnerabilities (CVE check)
** Licence validation
** Image Optimisation
** Simplified functional tests

== Docker Inc's strategy
* Secure Platform
* Secure Content
* Secure Access

== Secure Platform
* Secure Platform
** All available isolation containment
** Default security settings and profiles
** Docker Bench

== Secure Content
* Secure Content

image::images/prevention.jpg[prevention,550]

== Recommendations

[%step]
* Keep your host/images up-to-date
* "Bulkheading"
** Seperate disk partition for Docker
** Don't run other (non-Docker) applications on the same host
** Container in a VM ?
* Limit inter-container communications
* log/audit trails
* Access control

== Recommendations

[%step]
* Do not use "priviliged" if it is not necessary
* Applicative users in the containers
* Where are my images coming from ? are they up-to-date ?
* Access rights on the files

== Conclusions

* "Is Docker 'secure' ?"
** No more or less then the door of an apartment
* Security is everyone's business : DevOps + SecOps
