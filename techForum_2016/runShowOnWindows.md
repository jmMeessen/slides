= Starting the slide show on a Worldline Windows PC

* Start `Docker4wl`
* In the Docker4wl window, go to the directory containing the presentation with `cd /techforum`
* Start the HTTP server with `make show`
* On the web browser on the PC, call URL `localhost:8080/slides.html`

NOTE: the build doesn't work because the special asciidoc image is not available there.
