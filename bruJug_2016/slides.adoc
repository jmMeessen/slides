* Some "Proof of Concept" ?
* Use it every day ?
* In Production ?

== Today's talk

* What are "containers" ?
* How to start ?
* Docker for the Java Dev

Docker Container is an analogy to the revolution in the Shipping industry brought by the container.

== Docker Containers

* is not a virtualization technique,
* rather an *isolation* technology.

== Docker Containers are :

[%step]
* cgroups (control groups)
** limits CPU, memory, IOs, etc
* NameSpaces
** isolates and virtualizes system resources
*** (process, mounts, networking)

== !

[NOTE.speaker]

- Draw the attention on the Docker process.
- Containers are old, LXC (OpenVZ) been around for some time.
- Container load fast
--

== Applications packaged with system dependencies

* new packaging paradigm
* one application works on Ubuntu with Python 2
* second application works on Centos 7.2 with Python 3

== What Docker solves

[%step]
* Escape the dependencies hell
* Fast iterative Infrastructure improvement
* Container "loader" & Container "shipper"
** (no more "it worked in Dev, now it's OPS problem")
* easy onboarding of Devs.
* "Own test environment"

pass:[<p style="font-size:400%; font-family: 'League Gothic', Impact, sans-serif;">How to start ?</p>]

== Need a container enabled "Kernel"


== And for Windows or Mac OS X ?

[%step]
* Install a virtual machine (ex VirtualBox)
* Ready made bundles:
** Docker Toolbox
** New, better integrated, clients
* Using (corporate) proxies: advanced topic

pass:[<p style="font-size:400%; font-family: 'League Gothic', Impact, sans-serif;">How does it work ?</p>]

== Let me show you ....


== How do you get images ?

[%step]
* Note: an image is immutable
* you get them from
** DockerHub
** Corporate Registry
* Or build it yourself

== Building a Docker Image

* Described in a Dockerfile

== Describe a complete Infrastructure

* Complex systems

** how to (docker) build them

** (data) volumes
** Security restrictions
** Etc.


== "Build, Ship and Run"

image::images/buildShipRun.png[width=80%]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Build: easier to build application
- Ship: easier/faster to package and deploy apps
- Run: easier for microservices/cloud/orchestration

== How to learn ?

* Many tutorials available on-line
* https://training.docker.com/category/self-paced-online
** Developer
*** Beginner Linux Containers
*** Beginner Windows Containers
*** Intermediate (both Linux and Windows)
** Operations
*** Beginner

pass:[<p style="font-size:400%; font-family: 'League Gothic', Impact, sans-serif;">Where is Docker heading ?</p>]

== Docker Inc.

[%step]
* Docker has been surprised by this techno "flare"
* Very, very lively Open Source community
* "Batteries included"
* Standardization (RunC, etc.)

== Well grounded approach

* Coming from the web hosting world

image::images/docker_unusable_scy.jpg[width=80%]

== Status

* Was good for development and integration
* Start to be usable for Real Life Run
** Since December 2015

== Status

* Start to offer enterprise level solutions
** "Docker Datacenter"
*** Trusted Registry (Image scanning, sig/auth)
*** Docker Universal Control Plane
** Docker Cloud

pass:[<p style="font-size:400%; font-family: 'League Gothic', Impact, sans-serif;">Docker for Java builders</p>]

== integration tests

image::images/SytemUnderTest.png[width=110%]

== maven integration

* using `fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin`

== maven sequence

* pre-integration-test
** execute Docker "build" and "start" goals
** execute FlyWay migration
* integration-test
** execute Failsafe "verify" goal
** integration test make extensive use of DBunit
* post-integration-test
** execute Docker "stop" goal

== Maven integration

* additional options
** (networking, volumes, docker-compose)
* fits nicely in Jenkins
** especially V2 and pipeline
** (but this is an other story)

== Base images

* several base images are available, choose what is best suited
** openjdk (jdk and jre)
** openjdk:alpine
** maven
** Oracle JDK/JRE is not available from the shelf anymore. Need to build it yourself

== deployment model

* app-server
* embedded (self contained JAR)


== installation modes/test modes

* add the JAR in the right directory
* execute the app installation script at image build time
* execute the app installation script at container run

== single purpose JVM

* thinks it is alone in the world
** JVM defaults based on the machine characteristics
* watch out
** several JVMs (in Docker) are running on the same machine

== JVM configuration

* as on a physical host you need to specifiy/limit the memory/cpu requirement of your JVM
** Docker offer the same tools. use them
** orchestrator like mesos or kubernetes can help you for this
* beware of Docker exec in Production

== Docker in Production
* my point of view of Docker in Production
** you need to have a very good understanding of what you do
** still in the early phase
** Docker works very well for **state less** application
** State full (with databases, etc) still in infancy. Recent announcement very promising

== What are the dangers with Docker?

[%step]
* Kernel exploits
* Denial of service attack
* Container breakout
* Poisoned images
* Compromising Secrets

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Amplification.
* un container peut tout bloquer
* sortir
* Poisoned images
* access DB
--

== Is Docker "secure" ?

* A lot of expectations, of illusions
* "Silver bullet"
* Competition positioning (VM, Configuration Mgt)
* Enviousness

== "Container do not contain !"

* Wrong perception by the "public"
* Tremendous progress in 3 years
** but usable...

== Equipped with security tools

== In particular

* Cap drop
* User namespace
* selinux / apparmor

== Capability Drop

* options to the "Docker run"
* goes beyond the root/non-root dichotomy
* example: container with NTP

----
docker run --cap-drop ALL --cap-add SYS_TIME ntpd
----

== Selinux / apparmor

* profiles are called at each "Docker run"
* Allow to go much further in the granularity
** this program (ex ping) has no access to the network

== !

#include <tunables/global>

== "Clean" containers?

== !

* Malicious contents
* Contains vulnerabilities or bugged applications

== Trusted Registry

* Systematic use of TLS
* Re-enforcement of the layers integrity
* Upgraded with version 1.10

== Notary

* System of image signature and its validation
** Validation of the author and content non alteration
* Protection Against Image Forgery
* Protection Against Replay Attacks
* Protection Against Key Compromise
** Clever usage of physical key storage


== Nautilus

* (now called "Docker Security Scanning")
* Docker image scanner
** vulnerabilities (CVE check)
** Licence validation
** Image Optimisation
** Simplified functional tests


== Recommendations

image::images/prevention.jpg[prevention,550]

== Recommendations

[%step]
* Keep your host/images up-to-date
* "Bulkheading"
** Seperate disk partition for Docker
** Don't run other (non-Docker) applications on the same host
** Container in a VM ?
* Limit inter-container communications
* log/audit trails
* Access control

== Recommendations

[%step]
* Do not use "priviliged" if it is not necessary
* Applicative users in the containers
* Where are my images coming from ? are they up-to-date ?
* Access rights on the files

== Conclusions

* "Is Docker 'secure' ?"
** No more or less then the door of an apartment
* Security is everyone's business : DevOps + SecOps
